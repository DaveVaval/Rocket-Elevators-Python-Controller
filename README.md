# Rocket Elevators Python Controller 

![alt text]()

Welcome to the Ruby controller for Rocket Elevators! 

- Python is a fun and really clean language. So far one of my favorite programming languages!


An instance of column is created and when a en elevator is called, the column will send the best elevator to the user based on the different attributes of the elevators and the origin of the request.

In order to see it in action, paste one of these scenarios at the bottom of the script and run it in your terminal:

```
Scenario1() , Scenario2() , Scenario3()
```
